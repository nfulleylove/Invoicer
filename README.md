# Invoicer

Time is money. Invoicer is a very specific invoice generator, developed with one person in mind.

# Getting Started

An invoice can be created immediately. During the creation of an invoice, the default values will be added/updated.

## Default Values

To make invoice generation more efficient, default values are saved and entered on each subsequent invoice created.

### Personal Details

Personal Details contains all of the details of the person submitting the invoice.

### Payment Details

Payment Details contains the bank details of the person submitting the invoice. Best to check these details over twice!

### Companies

Multiple companies can be added if you find yourself working for different companies.

These can be updated if the company's details change. They can also be deleted if no longer required.

## Creating an Invoice

### Review and Send

When you tap on Review and Send, the invoice is saved. A preview of the invoice is shown and you have the option to print and email the invoice.

The invoice can be updated if there are any issues at this point.

When emailing the invoice, the email is populated for you using the PDF and the email of the company:
